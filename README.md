# Home Control System - with Security Aspect

Our proposed project will leverage the M5StickCPlus to implement motion detection with a lighting control system. The project entails utilizing a camera 
onboard a Raspberry Pi to detect motion and the M5StickCPlus to control the lighting of a light bulb. To enhance user experience, we intend to procure a rotary 
encoder that will enable color changes of the light bulb by turning the encoder and use the button click of the encoder to set the color output (on/off). Additionally,
our project will feature a security mode, which can be activated by double-clicking the M5StickCPlus button, that will detect motion, turn on the lights, and send an 
alert message to a designated phone or computer to notify the homeowner.
