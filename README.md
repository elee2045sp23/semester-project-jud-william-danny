# Home Control System - with Security Aspect

**Description of the desired functionality for the project/project (goals):**
Our proposed project will leverage the M5StickCPlus to implement motion detection with a lighting control system. The project entails utilizing a camera 
onboard a Raspberry Pi to detect motion and serve as a smart home hub and the M5StickCPlus to control the lighting of a light bulb. The Raspberry Pi will use a Zigbee USB Antenna to communicate with the lightbulbs while the M5 will use MQTT to communicate with the Raspberry Pi. To enhance user experience, we intend to procure a rotary encoder that will enable color changes of the light bulb by turning the encoder and use the button click of the encoder to set the color output (on/off). Additionally, our project will feature a security mode, which can be activated by double-clicking the M5StickCPlus button, which will detect motion, turn on the lights, and send an alert message to a designated phone or computer to notify the homeowner.

**Accomplishments for this project include:**
We integrated a Raspberry Pi, Smart lightbulbs, a camera, the M5StickCPlus, a rotary-encoder, and a graphical user interface via hardware connections and MQTT messaging. The lightbulbs are controlled by the M5/rotary-encoder to turn on/off and set the bulb color. The GUI does the same thing separate from the M5/rotary encoder. The camera tracks motion and can turn the bulb on in a "security mode".

<ins>William</ins> - I formatted the README.md file to look professional as well as ensuring our ideas for the project were conveyed clearly and concisely. I also added as many pictures as I could to the README.md to show progress that was made on the project. I also contributed the code to set up a GUI for the project. The GUI has the capability to control and display information for three smart bulbs when connected properly. I created a GUI similar to the one used in class. Then I found another library that make the GUI have a more modern look and feel. I added the code for the modern GUI underneath the first GUI.
